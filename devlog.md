# Audio Capture Debugging

## Issue
Gemini reports "not receiving audio" even though:
- WebSocket connection is stable ✓
- Silence detection works ✓
- End-of-turn signals work ✓

## Debugging Steps Applied

### 1. Lowered VAD Threshold
Changed from `0.01` to `0.001` to be more sensitive to quiet speech.

### 2. Added RMS Logging
The audio processor now logs every 100 chunks:
```
[AudioProcessor] RMS: 0.000XXX, Max RMS: 0.00XXXX, Voice: true/false
```

### 3. Temporarily Disabled VAD
Commented out the voice activity detection to send ALL audio data, including silence. This helps determine if:
- The microphone is capturing audio
- The audio levels are correct
- The VAD was filtering out actual speech

## What to Look For

1. **Check Console for RMS Values**:
   - Speaking should show RMS > 0.001
   - Silence should show RMS < 0.001
   - If all values are 0.000000, microphone isn't working

2. **Test Speech**:
   - Speak clearly into microphone
   - Watch for "Audio chunk sent" messages
   - Check if Gemini responds

3. **Silence Timer Still Works**:
   - Even with VAD disabled, the 1.5s silence timer should still trigger
   - You'll see "Audio turn ended (silence detected)"

## Next Steps

Based on RMS values:
- **All zeros**: Check microphone permissions/selection
- **Very low (< 0.0001)**: Microphone gain too low
- **Normal (> 0.001 when speaking)**: Re-enable VAD with adjusted threshold

## To Re-enable VAD

Uncomment the VAD logic in `audio-processor.js` and adjust `silenceThreshold` based on observed RMS values. 

# Audio Processor Fix - AudioWorklet Name Mismatch

## Issue Identified

When trying to enable the microphone, you were getting this error:
```
AudioWorkletNode cannot be created: The node name 'audio-processor' is not defined in AudioWorkletGlobalScope.
```

## Root Cause

There was a **name mismatch** between:
1. The AudioWorklet processor registration: `'audio-recorder-worklet'` (in `audio-processor.js` line 90)
2. The AudioWorkletNode creation: `'audio-processor'` (in `recorder.js` line 70)

## Fix Applied

### 1. Fixed the processor name in `recorder.js`:
```javascript
// OLD (incorrect)
this.processor = new AudioWorkletNode(this.audioContext, 'audio-processor');

// NEW (correct)
this.processor = new AudioWorkletNode(this.audioContext, 'audio-recorder-worklet', {
    processorOptions: { sampleRate: this.audioContext.sampleRate }
});
```

### 2. Fixed the message handler to properly convert audio data:
```javascript
// OLD (incorrect - expecting raw base64)
this.processor.port.onmessage = (event) => {
    if (this.onAudioData) {
        this.onAudioData(event.data);
    }
};

// NEW (correct - handling the worklet's data structure)
this.processor.port.onmessage = (event) => {
    if (event.data.event === 'chunk' && this.onAudioData) {
        // Convert the Int16Array buffer to base64
        const base64Data = arrayBufferToBase64(event.data.data.int16arrayBuffer);
        this.onAudioData(base64Data);
    }
};
```

## Testing the Fix

1. **Reload your page** on port 5500
2. **Click "Manual Initialize App"**
3. **Click the microphone toggle button**
4. You should now see:
   - "Microphone activated" message
   - No more AudioWorklet errors
   - Audio should be streaming to Gemini

## What This Enables

With this fix:
- ✅ Microphone can now be activated
- ✅ Audio is properly captured and converted to base64
- ✅ Audio streams are sent to Gemini for voice interactions
- ✅ You can now use voice commands to control your IoT devices

## Next Steps

Try these voice commands once the microphone is working:
- "Turn on the red LED"
- "What's the status of the Arduino?"
- "Toggle the green LED"

The audio processing pipeline is now properly connected:
`Microphone → AudioWorklet → Base64 Conversion → Gemini WebSocket → Response` 

# Audio Format Fix - Sample Rate Mismatch

## The Problem
Gemini was receiving audio but reporting "difficulties with the audio". This indicated a format mismatch.

## Root Cause
We were sending audio at **24kHz** but Gemini expects **16kHz**!

## Fix Applied

### 1. Changed AudioContext Sample Rate
```javascript
// gemini-agent.js
this.audioContext = new AudioContext({
    sampleRate: 16000  // Was 24000 (MODEL_SAMPLE_RATE)
});
```

### 2. Changed Microphone Request
```javascript
// audio/recorder.js
await navigator.mediaDevices.getUserMedia({ 
    audio: {
        sampleRate: 16000,  // Was this.sampleRate (24000)
        // ... other settings
    } 
});
```

### 3. Audio Format Details
- **Format**: 16-bit PCM (correct)
- **Sample Rate**: 16kHz (now fixed)
- **Channels**: Mono (correct)
- **Endianness**: Little-endian (JavaScript default)

## Testing

1. **Reload the page** (critical for new sample rate!)
2. **Connect and enable microphone**
3. **Speak clearly**: "Hello Gemini, turn on the red LED"
4. **Expected**: Gemini should understand and respond appropriately

## Debug Logging Added

Look for:
```
[AudioProcessor] RMS: 0.050000, Voice: true
[GeminiWebsocketClient] Audio chunk details: {
    mimeType: 'audio/pcm',
    dataLength: 2731,
    expectedFormat: '16-bit PCM @ 16kHz mono'
}
[GeminiWebsocketClient] Model turn parts: [
    { hasText: true, text: "I'll turn on the red LED", hasAudio: true }
]
```

## Why This Matters

- **24kHz**: Higher quality but not what Gemini expects
- **16kHz**: Standard for speech recognition systems
- **Mismatch**: Causes audio to be interpreted incorrectly

This should finally allow Gemini to understand your speech commands! 

# Continuous Audio Streaming Fix - Silence Detection

## The Core Issue

With continuous audio streaming enabled, Gemini was receiving a constant stream of audio data and **never knew when the user finished speaking**. This caused:
- Only the first message would get a response
- Subsequent messages would be ignored
- Gemini was perpetually waiting for the "end of turn"

### The Problem Flow:
1. Microphone ON → Audio streams continuously to Gemini
2. User speaks → Gemini receives audio
3. User stops speaking → **Audio still streams (silence)**
4. Gemini waits forever → **Never responds** ❌

## Solution: Automatic Silence Detection

I've implemented a silence detection mechanism that automatically signals "end of turn" after detecting 1.5 seconds of silence.

### How It Works:

1. **Audio Chunk Arrives** → Reset silence timer
2. **No Audio for 1.5 seconds** → Send end-of-turn signal
3. **Gemini Processes** → Responds to what was said
4. **Ready for Next Input** → Natural conversation flow

## Code Changes

### 1. Added `sendEndOfTurn()` method in `gemini-websocket-client.js`:
```javascript
async sendEndOfTurn() {
    const endOfTurnSignal = { 
        clientContent: { 
            turns: [], 
            turnComplete: true 
        } 
    };
    await this.sendJSON(endOfTurnSignal);
    console.debug(`[GeminiWebsocketClient] End of turn signal sent`);
}
```

### 2. Added silence detection in `gemini-agent.js`:
```javascript
// In constructor
this.silenceTimeout = null;
this.silenceThresholdMs = 1500; // 1.5 seconds of silence ends turn
this.lastAudioTimestamp = null;

// In sendAudio method
this.silenceTimeout = setTimeout(async () => {
    await this.websocketClient.sendEndOfTurn();
    console.debug('GeminiAgent: End of turn sent after silence');
}, this.silenceThresholdMs);
```

## Testing the Fix

1. **Reload your page** on port 5500
2. **Initialize and activate microphone**
3. **Natural conversation flow:**
   - Speak: "Hello Gemini"
   - **Pause for 1.5 seconds**
   - Gemini responds
   - Speak: "Turn on the red LED"
   - **Pause for 1.5 seconds**
   - Gemini responds and controls LED
   - Continue naturally!

## Benefits

✅ **Natural conversation** - Speak and pause like normal conversation
✅ **No manual intervention** - Automatic turn detection
✅ **Continuous dialogue** - Multiple back-and-forth exchanges
✅ **Voice-controlled IoT** - Commands work reliably

## Customization

You can adjust the silence threshold if needed:
```javascript
this.silenceThresholdMs = 1500; // Change to 2000 for 2 seconds, etc.
```

- **Shorter** (e.g., 1000ms): Faster responses but might cut off longer pauses
- **Longer** (e.g., 2000ms): More tolerant of pauses but slower to respond

## How It's Different From Text

- **Text Input**: Explicitly signals end-of-turn when you press Enter
- **Audio Input**: Now automatically detects end-of-turn after silence

This creates a more natural voice interaction experience where you can speak freely and Gemini will respond when you pause, just like a real conversation! 

# Audio Recognition Debugging

## Current Issue
- Gemini detects that you're speaking (responds with "I'm ready")
- But doesn't understand WHAT you're saying
- Suggests audio format/encoding issue, not capture issue

## Changes Made

### 1. Reduced Silence Timer
- Back to 1.5 seconds for faster responses

### 2. Removed Transcription Config
- Removed empty `inputAudioTranscription` and `outputAudioTranscription`
- These might have been causing issues

### 3. Added Text to Response Modalities
```javascript
responseModalities: ["audio", "text"]
```
- Now Gemini can respond with both audio AND text
- Should help debug if it's understanding you

### 4. Added Debug Logging
- Now logs what Gemini is sending back:
```
[GeminiWebsocketClient] Model turn parts: [
  { hasText: true, text: "I heard you but...", hasAudio: true }
]
```

## What to Look For

1. **Check the Model Turn Parts log**:
   - If `hasText: true` with meaningful text = Gemini understands
   - If `hasText: true` with generic text = Gemini doesn't understand
   - If `hasText: false` = Only audio response

2. **Test with Clear Commands**:
   - "Hello Gemini"
   - "What is 2 plus 2?"
   - "Turn on the red LED"

3. **Check for Text Responses**:
   - Look for `GeminiAgent: Processing text part:` in console
   - This shows what text Gemini is sending

## Possible Issues

1. **Audio Encoding**: PCM format might be wrong
2. **Sample Rate**: 24000 Hz might not match what Gemini expects
3. **Language/Accent**: Try speaking very clearly
4. **Background Noise**: Try in a quiet environment

## Next Steps

Based on what you see in the logs:
- If NO text responses: Audio format issue
- If GENERIC text responses: Audio quality/clarity issue
- If GOOD text responses: Display issue in UI

Please test and share what you see in the "Model turn parts" log! 

# Complete Voice Conversation Solution

## Final Configuration

After analyzing your audio levels, here's the working configuration:

### Voice Activity Detection (VAD)
- **Silence Threshold**: `0.001` (detects speech > 0.001 RMS)
- **Silent Chunks Before Skip**: `50` (captures trailing speech)
- **Silence Timer**: `2000ms` (2 seconds before end-of-turn)

### How It Works Now

1. **Speaking Phase**:
   - VAD detects speech (RMS > 0.001)
   - Audio is sent to Gemini
   - Silence timer resets with each chunk

2. **Pause Detection**:
   - VAD detects silence (RMS < 0.001)
   - Continues sending for 50 chunks (~1.25 seconds)
   - Then stops sending audio
   - Message: "[AudioProcessor] Stopped sending silent audio"

3. **Turn Completion**:
   - After 2 seconds total silence
   - End-of-turn signal sent
   - Message: "Audio turn ended (silence detected)"
   - Gemini responds

4. **Continuous Flow**:
   - After Gemini responds, ready for next input
   - Natural back-and-forth conversation

## Expected Log Flow

```
[AudioProcessor] RMS: 0.050000, Voice: true    // Speaking
[AudioProcessor] RMS: 0.000050, Voice: false   // Stopped speaking
[AudioProcessor] Stopped sending silent audio   // After ~1.25s
GeminiAgent: End of turn sent after silence    // After 2s total
[Gemini responds with audio/text]
System: Model turn complete
[Ready for next interaction]
```

## Usage Tips

1. **Speak normally** - The VAD threshold is tuned for your mic
2. **Natural pauses** - 2 second silence triggers response
3. **No toggle needed** - Leave mic on for continuous conversation
4. **Clear endings** - Pause clearly between questions

## Troubleshooting

- **No response**: Check for "End of turn sent" message
- **Cut off mid-sentence**: Speak more continuously, avoid long pauses
- **Too sensitive**: Increase `silenceThreshold` to 0.002
- **Not sensitive enough**: Lower `silenceThreshold` to 0.0005

## All Issues Fixed

✅ WebSocket stability (proper end-of-turn format)
✅ Audio capture (verified with RMS logging)
✅ Voice activity detection (tuned to your levels)
✅ Silence detection (2s timer with VAD cooperation)
✅ Continuous conversation (proper state management)
✅ Error handling (graceful disconnection handling)

The system now supports natural voice conversations with Gemini! 

# Gemini Turn Management Fixes - UPDATED

## Issues Identified and Fixed

### 1. **Priming Message Problem** ✅ FIXED
- **Issue**: The priming message "Hello! I'm ready to help you control your IoT devices." was being treated as user input, causing Gemini to respond with "Great!" when no user spoke
- **Solution**: Changed to send a simple `'.'` trigger like the working demo, which doesn't confuse the conversation flow

### 2. **Excessive Audio Logging** ✅ FIXED  
- **Issue**: Console was flooded with audio data logs every few milliseconds making debugging impossible
- **Solution**: 
  - Reduced `sendAudio` logging to only 1% of chunks
  - Removed verbose base64 audio data logging from `sendJSON`
  - Only log non-audio messages in `sendJSON`

### 3. **Complex Event Processing** ✅ FIXED
- **Issue**: Overcomplicated turn management with unnecessary state tracking
- **Solution**: Simplified `receive()` method to match working demo pattern:
  - Cleaner event processing order
  - Removed complex streaming message tracking
  - Simpler turn completion handling

### 4. **Audio Recorder Verbosity** ✅ FIXED
- **Issue**: Too many debug logs from audio processing
- **Solution**: Streamlined audio recorder initialization and reduced logging

## Test Results Expected

After these fixes, you should see:
1. **No premature "Great!" message** - Only responses to actual user input
2. **Much cleaner console** - Minimal audio logging spam
3. **Proper turn management** - Gemini should respond consistently to your messages
4. **Working audio responses** - Audio playback should work correctly

## Testing Instructions

1. Reload your page on port 5500
2. Click "Manual Initialize App" 
3. The console should be much cleaner with only essential logs
4. When you speak or type "test", Gemini should respond appropriately
5. You should NOT see the "Great!" message anymore

## Key Changes Made

### `gemini-agent.js`
- Replaced priming message with simple `'.'` trigger
- Simplified initialization flow

### `gemini-websocket-client.js`  
- Reduced audio logging from every chunk to 1% sampling
- Removed verbose base64 data logging
- Simplified event processing logic
- Cleaner turn management

### `audio/recorder.js`
- Reduced initialization logging verbosity
- Streamlined audio processing setup

These changes align your implementation with the working demo's patterns while maintaining your IoT device integration features. 

# Turn Management Fix - Streaming State Reset

## Issue Identified

After the first successful interaction with Gemini, subsequent messages were not getting responses. The logs showed:
- First message: Works perfectly
- Subsequent messages: No response from Gemini
- Multiple "Model turn complete" messages but no new responses

## Root Cause

The `currentStreamingMessage` state variable was not being reset after each turn completed. This caused the system to think it was still in the middle of streaming a message, preventing new messages from being properly handled.

### The Problem Flow:
1. First message arrives → `currentStreamingMessage = null` → Triggers `gemini_text_start` ✓
2. During streaming → `currentStreamingMessage = true`
3. Turn completes → `currentStreamingMessage` **stays true** ❌
4. Next message arrives → `currentStreamingMessage = true` → Doesn't trigger `gemini_text_start` ❌

## Fix Applied

# Major Dewab Library Refactoring - Architecture Improvement

## Overview

Completed a comprehensive refactoring of the Dewab library to improve architecture, readability, and maintainability. The refactoring focused on creating a unified public API and decoupling components for better separation of concerns.

## Refactoring Goals

- **Single Entry Point**: Make Dewab class the unified interface for all functionality
- **Decoupling**: Remove direct dependencies between core components and UI
- **Simplification**: Reduce complexity in main.js and improve code clarity
- **Maintainability**: Create cleaner, more understandable codebase

## Changes Implemented

### Step 1: Enhanced Dewab Class with Complete Public API ✅

**File**: `dewab/index.js`

**Major Additions**:
- **Constructor configuration support**: Accept config object with supabase URLs, Gemini API key, DOM elements
- **Lifecycle methods**: `connect()` and `disconnect()` for proper service management
- **Status methods**: `isConnected()`, `isGeminiReady()`, `isMicrophoneActive()`, `getStatus()`
- **Unified Gemini methods**: `sendTextMessageToGemini()`, `toggleMicrophone()`
- **Enhanced JSDoc**: Complete documentation for all public methods
- **Backward compatibility**: Deprecated legacy methods with warnings

**Benefits**:
- Single, clear interface for all Dewab functionality
- Proper lifecycle management with error handling
- Comprehensive status checking capabilities
- Professional API design with full documentation

### Step 2: Decoupled SupabaseDeviceClient from ChatInterface ✅

**File**: `dewab/core/supabase-device-client.js`

**Changes Made**:
- **Removed direct ChatInterface dependency**: No longer creates ChatInterface instance
- **Event-based communication**: Replaced `this.chat.displaySystemNotification()` calls with `eventBus.emit()`
- **Cleaner separation**: Device client focuses solely on device communication
- **Event emission**: Uses `EVENT_TYPES.DEVICE_ERROR` for system messages

**File**: `dewab/index.js` (Event Bridge Enhancement)

**Added Device Event Handlers**:
- `DEVICE_ERROR`: Displays device error messages in chat
- `DEVICE_STATE_UPDATED`: Logs device state changes
- `DEVICE_COMMAND_SENT`: Logs command executions

**Benefits**:
- Proper separation of concerns
- Device layer no longer coupled to UI layer
- Event-driven architecture for better flexibility
- Easier testing and maintenance

### Step 3: Simplified main.js Using Unified API ✅

**File**: `main.js`

**Major Simplifications**:
- **Removed direct SupabaseDeviceClient instantiation**: Now managed internally by Dewab
- **Replaced `getGeminiService()` pattern**: Direct dewab method calls (`dewab.sendTextMessageToGemini()`)
- **Unified connection management**: `dewab.connect()` instead of separate service connections
- **Simplified event handling**: Removed redundant event listeners, leveraging Dewab's internal handling
- **Cleaner code structure**: Reduced from 337 lines to 239 lines (-97 lines, -29%)

**API Changes**:
```javascript
// OLD PATTERN
const dewabClient = new SupabaseDeviceClient(targetDeviceName);
const geminiService = dewab.getGeminiService();
await dewab.connectGemini(targetDeviceName);
await geminiService.sendMessage(text);

// NEW PATTERN  
await dewab.connect();
await dewab.sendTextMessageToGemini(text);
```

**Benefits**:
- Much simpler and more readable code
- Single API surface reduces confusion
- Fewer moving parts means fewer bugs
- Easier onboarding for new developers

## Testing Results ✅

Comprehensive testing confirmed all functionality works correctly:

### Connection Testing
- ✅ **Page loads successfully**: No console errors, proper initialization
- ✅ **Connect button works**: Dewab services connect properly
- ✅ **Status updates correctly**: UI reflects connection state accurately
- ✅ **Tool registration**: All 3 tools (SET_LED_STATE, GET_DEVICE_STATE, get_time) registered successfully

### Gemini Integration Testing  
- ✅ **Text communication**: "Hello" test message works, Gemini responds appropriately
- ✅ **Chat interface**: Messages display correctly in UI
- ✅ **Turn management**: Proper conversation flow with "Model turn complete"
- ✅ **Event system**: All event bridges functioning correctly

### UI/UX Testing
- ✅ **Button states**: Proper enable/disable behavior
- ✅ **Status display**: Connection status updates correctly  
- ✅ **LED controls**: Device control buttons become available after connection
- ✅ **Microphone button**: Audio functionality ready for use

## Code Quality Improvements

### Before Refactoring Issues:
- Multiple entry points (SupabaseDeviceClient, GeminiService, Dewab)
- Direct coupling between device layer and UI layer
- Complex event handling with duplication
- Unclear responsibilities between classes
- main.js with excessive boilerplate

### After Refactoring Benefits:
- **Single entry point**: Dewab class manages everything
- **Clean separation**: Device, AI, and UI layers properly decoupled
- **Event-driven**: Loose coupling through event bus
- **Clear responsibilities**: Each class has a focused purpose
- **Simplified usage**: Much easier to understand and use

## Architecture Diagram

```
OLD ARCHITECTURE:
main.js → SupabaseDeviceClient (directly) 
main.js → GeminiService (directly)
main.js → Dewab (partially)
SupabaseDeviceClient → ChatInterface (tightly coupled)

NEW ARCHITECTURE:
main.js → Dewab (unified interface)
  ├── Dewab → SupabaseDeviceClient (managed internally)
  ├── Dewab → GeminiAgent (managed internally)  
  ├── Dewab → ChatInterface (managed internally)
  └── EventBus → All components (loosely coupled)
```

## Impact Assessment

### Maintainability: **Significantly Improved**
- Single API to learn and maintain
- Clear separation of concerns
- Event-driven architecture
- Comprehensive documentation

### Readability: **Much Better**
- main.js is 29% smaller and much clearer
- Obvious API patterns (dewab.connect(), dewab.sendTextMessage())
- Less cognitive overhead understanding the system

### Extensibility: **Enhanced**
- Easy to add new device types (just extend Dewab)
- Simple to add new Gemini features (add methods to Dewab)
- Event system allows easy feature additions

### Testing: **Easier**
- Components are properly decoupled
- Clear interfaces for mocking
- Event system enables isolated testing

## Conclusion

The refactoring successfully achieved all goals:
- ✅ **Unified API**: Single Dewab interface for all functionality
- ✅ **Proper Decoupling**: Components communicate through events, not direct references
- ✅ **Simplified Usage**: main.js is much cleaner and easier to understand
- ✅ **Maintained Functionality**: All existing features work exactly as before
- ✅ **Better Architecture**: Professional, maintainable code structure

This refactoring sets up the Dewab library for future growth while making it much easier to work with for current development needs.

### 1. Reset state in `turn_complete` handler:
```javascript
// Handle turn completion
this.websocketClient.on('turn_complete', () => {
    // Reset streaming state for next turn
    this.currentStreamingMessage = null;  // ← ADDED THIS
    
    this.emit('gemini_text_end');
    this.emit('gemini_system_message', "Model turn complete");
    if (this.audioStreamer) {
        this.audioStreamer.markStreamComplete();
    }
});
```

### 2. Reset state in `interrupted` handler:
```javascript
// Handle model interruptions by stopping audio playback
this.websocketClient.on('interrupted', () => {
    // Reset streaming state
    this.currentStreamingMessage = null;  // ← ADDED THIS
    
    if (this.audioStreamer) {
        this.audioStreamer.stop();
        this.audioStreamer.isInitialized = false;
    }
    this.emit('gemini_text_end');
    this.emit('gemini_system_message', "Model interaction interrupted");
});
```

## Testing the Fix

1. **Reload your page** on port 5500
2. **Initialize and activate the microphone**
3. **Have a continuous conversation:**
   - Say: "Hello"
   - Wait for response
   - Say: "Turn on the red LED"
   - Wait for response
   - Say: "What's the status?"
   - Each message should now get a response!

## What This Enables

✅ **Continuous conversations** - Multiple back-and-forth interactions
✅ **Proper turn management** - Each turn properly resets for the next
✅ **Voice-controlled IoT** - Sequential commands work correctly
✅ **No manual reset needed** - The system automatically prepares for the next turn

## How It Works Now

1. User speaks → Audio streams to Gemini
2. Gemini responds → Audio/text streams back
3. Turn completes → **State resets automatically**
4. Ready for next interaction immediately

The conversation flow is now truly continuous, allowing natural back-and-forth dialogue with Gemini for controlling your IoT devices! 

# WebSocket Closure Fix - Invalid End-of-Turn Format

## Critical Issue

The WebSocket was closing with error code 1007: "Request contains an invalid argument" immediately after sending the end-of-turn signal. This crashed the entire connection.

## Root Cause

The `sendEndOfTurn()` method was sending an invalid format:
```javascript
// WRONG - This format is invalid
{
    clientContent: {
        turns: [],      // Empty turns array is invalid
        turnComplete: true
    }
}
```

## Fix Applied

### 1. Fixed `sendEndOfTurn()` in `gemini-websocket-client.js`:
```javascript
// CORRECT - Use sendText with empty string
async sendEndOfTurn() {
    await this.sendText('', true);  // Empty text with turnComplete=true
}
```

### 2. Added proper cleanup on WebSocket close in `gemini-agent.js`:
- Stop audio recording immediately
- Clear silence timeout
- Reset connection state
- Prevent further audio sending

### 3. Added connection guards in `sendAudio()`:
- Check if connected before sending
- Don't throw errors that break the audio pipeline
- Check connection before sending end-of-turn

## Result

- WebSocket connection remains stable
- No cascade of errors after disconnect
- Proper cleanup on connection loss
- Audio recording stops gracefully

## Testing

1. Reload the page
2. Connect and enable microphone
3. Speak and pause
4. Should see "Audio turn ended (silence detected)"
5. WebSocket should remain connected
6. Gemini should respond properly

## Note for Rollback

If issues persist, the main changes to revert are:
1. `sendEndOfTurn()` method in gemini-websocket-client.js
2. WebSocket close handler in gemini-agent.js
3. Connection guards in sendAudio() method 

# Improved Turn Management - Fix Multiple Responses

## The Problem
- Gemini was responding multiple times to the same input
- Long delays followed by multiple rapid responses
- Initial trigger message causing extra response on connection

## Root Causes
1. **Initial trigger message** ('.') causing immediate response on connect
2. **No turn management** - multiple end-of-turn signals could be sent
3. **Silence detection too aggressive** - 1.5 seconds was too short
4. **No debouncing** - rapid turn_complete events not filtered
5. **End-of-turn sent while Gemini is responding** - Causing interruptions and duplicate replies.

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Removed Initial Trigger
```javascript
// REMOVED this code that was causing extra response:
// await this.websocketClient.sendText('.');
```

### 2. Added Turn Management State
```javascript
// Track if we're processing a turn to prevent overlaps
this.isProcessingTurn = false;
this.lastTurnCompleteTime = 0;
this.isGeminiResponding = false; // NEW: Tracks if Gemini is actively sending a response
```

### 3. Increased Silence Timeout
```javascript
this.silenceThresholdMs = 2000; // Was 1500ms
```

### 4. Debounced Turn Completion
```javascript
// Ignore rapid turn_complete events (within 1 second)
if (timeSinceLastTurn < 1000) {
    console.debug('Ignoring rapid turn_complete');
    return;
}
```

### 5. Prevented Simultaneous Turn Endings and Overlaps
```javascript
// In sendAudio's silence timeout:
if (!this.connected || this.isProcessingTurn || this.isGeminiResponding) {
    console.debug('GeminiAgent: Skipping end of turn signal - not connected, processing turn, or Gemini is responding.');
    return;
}
this.isProcessingTurn = true;

// In websocketClient.on('audio') and websocketClient.on('content'):
this.isGeminiResponding = true;

// In websocketClient.on('interrupted') and websocketClient.on('turn_complete'):
this.isGeminiResponding = false;
```

## Expected Behavior

1. **No immediate response on connect** - Gemini waits for user input
2. **Single response per input** - No duplicate responses or truncated replies
3. **Better silence detection** - 2 seconds reduces false positives
4. **Smoother conversation flow** - No rapid multiple responses, and proper turn-taking.

## Testing

1. Reload the page
2. Connect (should NOT get immediate response)
3. Enable microphone
4. Speak clearly and pause
5. Should get ONE response after 2 seconds of silence

The conversation should now flow naturally without multiple responses! 

# Dewab Library Folder Structure Refactoring - Import Path Fixes

## Issue
After refactoring the Dewab library folder structure, several import paths were broken and needed to be updated to reflect the new organization.

## Root Cause
The library was reorganized from:
- `gemini-client/` → `dewab/gemini/`
- `dewab-client/` → `dewab/`
- `supabase-client/` → `dewab/supabase/`

But some import paths still referenced the old structure.

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Audio Worklet Path (Critical Fix)
**File**: `dewab/gemini/audio/recorder.js` line 66
```javascript
// OLD (broken)
await this.audioContext.audioWorklet.addModule('./gemini-client/audio/worklets/audio-processor.js');

// NEW (fixed)
await this.audioContext.audioWorklet.addModule('./worklets/audio-processor.js');
```

### 2. Documentation Updates
**Files**: `dewab/gemini/README.md`, `GUIDE.md`
- Updated all references from `gemini-client/` to `dewab/gemini/`
- Fixed example import paths in documentation
- Updated architecture diagrams and folder references

### 3. Cleaned Up Obsolete Comments
**File**: `ui/ui-manager.js`
- Removed commented import that referenced old path
- Added clarifying comment about ChatManager being internal to DewabChatAPI

## Final Verified Structure
```
dewab/
├── dewab.js
├── dewab-client.js  
├── dewab-chat-api.js
├── gemini/
│   ├── gemini-agent.js
│   ├── gemini-config.js
│   ├── gemini-integration.js
│   ├── gemini-utils.js
│   ├── gemini-websocket-client.js
│   ├── audio/
│   │   ├── audio-visualizer.js
│   │   ├── recorder.js
│   │   ├── streamer.js
│   │   └── worklets/
│   │       └── audio-processor.js
│   └── tools/
│       ├── get-arduino-state-tool.js
│       ├── set-led-state-tool.js
│       └── tool-manager.js
└── supabase/
    └── supabase-client.js
```

## Result
✅ All import paths now correctly reference the new folder structure
✅ Audio worklet loading works properly
✅ Documentation reflects current architecture 
✅ No more import errors on application startup
✅ Dewab library is properly organized and maintainable

## Git Commit
Committed all changes with comprehensive documentation of the fixes applied. The refactored structure makes the Dewab library more organized and easier to understand for future development. 

# Voice Activity Detection Fix

## The Problem

Even with silence detection timer, Gemini wasn't responding because:
1. **Audio worklet was sending continuous data** - Even during silence (zeros)
2. **Silence timer kept resetting** - Every silent audio chunk reset the timer
3. **End-of-turn never sent** - Timer never reached 1.5 seconds

## The Solution: Voice Activity Detection (VAD)

I've added intelligent voice activity detection to the audio worklet that:
1. **Detects actual speech** vs silence using RMS (Root Mean Square) 
2. **Stops sending silent chunks** after detecting continuous silence
3. **Allows silence timer to trigger** and send end-of-turn

## How It Works

### In `audio-processor.js`:
```javascript
// Calculate audio energy level
const rms = this.calculateRMS(audioSamples);
const hasVoiceActivity = rms > this.silenceThreshold;

if (hasVoiceActivity) {
    // Send audio data when voice detected
    this.processChunk(audioData);
} else {
    // Stop sending after 10 silent chunks
    // This allows the silence timer to trigger
}
```

## The Complete Flow

1. **User speaks** → VAD detects voice → Audio sent to Gemini
2. **User stops** → VAD detects silence → Stops sending after brief period
3. **No audio for 1.5s** → Silence timer triggers → End-of-turn sent
4. **Gemini responds** → Natural conversation continues

## Debugging Added

I've also added debug logging to help troubleshoot:
- `GeminiAgent: Received content event:` - Shows if Gemini is sending responses
- `GeminiAgent: Processing text part:` - Shows text being processed
- `GeminiAgent: Audio chunk sent` - Samples audio activity (1% of chunks)
- `GeminiAgent: End of turn sent after silence` - Confirms silence detection

## Testing

1. **Reload the page**
2. **Connect and enable microphone**
3. **Speak clearly** then **pause naturally**
4. You should see:
   - Audio chunks being sent while speaking
   - "End of turn sent after silence" after pausing
   - Gemini's response both as text and audio

## Tuning Parameters

If needed, you can adjust:
- `silenceThreshold`: 0.01 (lower = more sensitive to quiet sounds)
- `silentChunksBeforeSkip`: 10 (chunks to send after voice stops)
- `silenceThresholdMs`: 1500 (milliseconds before end-of-turn)

This creates a much more natural voice interaction! 

# Audio Worklet Path Fix - Browser Loading Issue

## Issue
The audio worklet was failing to load with error: `AbortError: Unable to load a worklet's module.` This prevented the microphone functionality from working in the application.

## Root Cause  
During the folder structure refactoring, the audio worklet path in `dewab/gemini/audio/recorder.js` was incorrectly updated. The browser resolves worklet paths relative to the HTML page (index.html), not relative to the JavaScript file making the request.

**Previous incorrect path**: `./worklets/audio-processor.js`
**Actual worklet location**: `dewab/gemini/audio/worklets/audio-processor.js`

## Fix Applied
**File**: `dewab/gemini/audio/recorder.js` line 67
```javascript
// OLD (incorrect)
await this.audioContext.audioWorklet.addModule('./worklets/audio-processor.js');

// NEW (correct)
await this.audioContext.audioWorklet.addModule('./dewab/gemini/audio/worklets/audio-processor.js');
```

## Additional Changes
- Added debug logging to track worklet loading process
- Path now correctly resolves from the root index.html location

## Result
✅ Audio worklet now loads successfully  
✅ Microphone functionality restored  
✅ No more "Unable to load a worklet's module" errors

## Testing
1. Reload the page on localhost:5500
2. Click to initialize the application
3. Enable microphone - should work without errors
4. Voice activity detection should now function properly

## 2024-12-19: Event Bus Architecture Refactoring ✅ COMPLETED

### Problem Identified
The event system had become overly complex with multiple layers of event forwarding:
- **Complex forwarding chains**: Events flowed through multiple layers (AudioManager → GeminiAgent → GeminiIntegration → DewabChatAPI)
- **Duplicate listeners**: Both main.js and GeminiIntegration listened to the same GeminiAgent events
- **Tight coupling**: Components needed to know about each other to forward events
- **Hard to debug**: Event flow was scattered across multiple files

### Solution Implemented: Central Event Bus Pattern
**Architecture**: Created a singleton event bus that all components publish to and subscribe from.

### Key Files Changed

#### 1. Created `dewab/event-bus.js` ✅
- **ApplicationEventBus class**: Extends EventEmitter with debug capabilities
- **EVENT_TYPES constants**: All event types defined in one place for IDE support
- **Debug mode**: Can enable logging to trace all events
- **Namespaced events**: Events organized by component (gemini:, audio:, device:, ui:)

#### 2. Updated `dewab/gemini/gemini-agent.js` ✅  
- **Dual emission approach**: Events sent to both old system and event bus during migration
- **No breaking changes**: All existing functionality preserved
- **Cleaner structure**: Less complex event forwarding logic

#### 3. Migrated `dewab/gemini/gemini-integration.js` ✅
- **Event bus subscribers**: Now listens to eventBus instead of geminiClient directly
- **Eliminated forwarding**: No more complex event relay chains
- **Same functionality**: All chat integration features preserved

#### 4. Centralized `main.js` event handling ✅
- **setupCentralizedEventListeners()**: Single function managing all app-level events
- **Event bus only**: No more duplicate listeners on GeminiAgent
- **Better organization**: All event handling in one clear location

### Benefits Achieved

1. **Single Source of Truth**: All events flow through one central bus
2. **No More Forwarding**: Components publish directly to the bus
3. **Clear Event Types**: All events documented in EVENT_TYPES constant
4. **Easy Debugging**: Enable debug mode to see all events: `eventBus.setDebugMode(true)`
5. **Loose Coupling**: Components don't need to know about each other
6. **Easy Testing**: Mock the event bus for unit tests
7. **Future-Proof**: Easy to add new components or change event handling

### Testing Results ✅ ALL PASSED

- ✅ **Connection Test**: Gemini Agent connects successfully
- ✅ **Event Flow**: All events flow correctly through event bus
- ✅ **UI Integration**: All buttons and status updates working
- ✅ **Chat System**: Text and audio messaging working  
- ✅ **Device Control**: IoT device integration intact
- ✅ **No Breaking Changes**: All existing functionality preserved

### Event Flow Before vs After

**Before (Complex)**:
```
AudioManager → GeminiAgent → GeminiIntegration → DewabChatAPI
              ↓           ↓
            main.js    (duplicate listeners)
```

**After (Clean)**:
```
All Components → EventBus ← All Subscribers
                    ↓
              (single source of truth)
```

### Next Steps for Further Improvement
- Remove dual emission once fully confident in new system
- Add event bus monitoring/analytics  
- Consider adding event replay capabilities for debugging
- Add TypeScript definitions for better IDE support

### Git Commits
- **Checkpoint**: Pre-refactoring stable state preserved

# Single Import API Consolidation ✅ COMPLETED

## 2024-12-19: Unified Import Statement

**Objective**: Eliminate the awkward two-import pattern and provide a single, clean import for the Dewab library.

### Problem Identified
Users had to make two separate imports to use the library:
```javascript
import { Dewab } from './dewab/index.js';
import { eventBus, EVENT_TYPES } from './dewab/event-bus.js';
```

This created unnecessary friction and made the library feel fragmented.

### Solution Implemented: Consolidated Exports

#### 1. Updated Main Export in `dewab/index.js` ✅
- **Added eventBus and EVENT_TYPES** to the main export statement
- **Maintained all existing exports** for backward compatibility
- **Single source**: Everything now exports from `dewab/index.js`

**Before**:
```javascript
export { Dewab, DeviceProxy, ToolRegistry, ChatInterface, SupabaseDeviceClient, UnifiedToolManager };
```

4. **Reduced Cognitive Load**: Users don't need to remember multiple import paths
5. **Professional API Design**: Follows modern library design patterns
6. **Backward Compatible**: All existing functionality preserved

### Updated Examples

**Before (Awkward)**:
```javascript
import { Dewab } from './dewab/index.js';
import { eventBus, EVENT_TYPES } from './dewab/event-bus.js';

const dewab = await Dewab.create(config);
eventBus.on(EVENT_TYPES.GEMINI_CONNECTED, handler);
```

**After (Clean)**:
```javascript
import { Dewab, eventBus, EVENT_TYPES } from './dewab/index.js';

const dewab = await Dewab.create(config);
eventBus.on(EVENT_TYPES.GEMINI_CONNECTED, handler);
```

### Files Updated ✅
- **dewab/index.js**: Added eventBus and EVENT_TYPES to exports

## 2024-12-30 - Fixed Gemini WebSocket Connection Issues

### Problem
The demo was unresponsive - the WebSocket connection to Gemini was being established but then immediately closed, preventing any communication with the API.

### Root Cause
The audio transcription configuration in `gemini-config.js` was using empty objects for `inputAudioTranscription` and `outputAudioTranscription`, which caused the Gemini API to reject the setup message.

### Solution
1. **Fixed audio transcription configuration**: Added proper model specification
   ```javascript
   inputAudioTranscription: {
       model: "models/gemini-2.0-flash-exp"
   },
   outputAudioTranscription: {
       model: "models/gemini-2.0-flash-exp"
   }
   ```

2. **Enhanced WebSocket error logging**: Added detailed close code explanations to help debug connection issues

3. **Result**: The demo now successfully connects to Gemini and can exchange messages. Tested with "Hello Gemini, can you hear me?" and received proper response.

### Files Modified
- `dewab/gemini/gemini-config.js` - Fixed audio transcription configuration
- `dewab/gemini/connection/websocket-transport.js` - Added detailed close code logging
- `dewab/gemini/gemini-agent.js` - Fixed connection logic

### Verification
Successfully tested the demo at http://localhost:8000/demo - Gemini responds to messages and the WebSocket connection remains stable.

# Checkpoint: AudioWorklet Fix and Duplicate UI Messages Eliminated

## Summary of Fixes

This checkpoint addresses two primary issues:

1.  **Duplicate UI Messages**: The chat UI was displaying redundant status messages, particularly "Initializing audio system...", "Gemini Agent connected and initialized", and "Gemini connected!".
    *   **Cause**: Redundant `eventBus.emit` calls in `audio-manager.js`, `gemini-agent.js`, and `index.js`, as well as overlapping status updates.
    *   **Resolution**: Removed or commented out duplicate `eventBus.emit(EVENT_TYPES.GEMINI_STATUS_UPDATE, ...)` and `eventBus.emit(EVENT_TYPES.GEMINI_CONNECTED, ...)` calls in:
        *   `dewab/gemini/audio/audio-manager.js`
        *   `dewab/gemini/gemini-agent.js`
        *   `dewab/index.js`

2.  **AudioWorklet Module Loading Error**: The microphone functionality was failing with an "Unable to load a worklet's module." error, preventing voice interaction.
    *   **Cause**: Incorrect relative path for loading `audio-processor.js` in `recorder.js`. The path was not resolving correctly from the browser's perspective (relative to the HTML document's base URL).
    *   **Resolution**: Corrected the `audioContext.audioWorklet.addModule` path in `dewab/gemini/audio/recorder.js` from `./worklets/audio-processor.js` to `../dewab/gemini/audio/worklets/audio-processor.js` to correctly reflect the path relative to the HTML document being served.

## Verification

-   The chat UI now displays cleaner, non-duplicate status messages during initialization.
-   The microphone can be toggled without the "Unable to load a worklet's module." error.
-   Voice interaction with the Gemini agent is now functional.

These changes significantly improve the user experience by providing clear feedback and enabling core voice capabilities.## API Simplification - 2025-06-09 08:44

Simplified the Dewab library's initialization API to reduce confusion and improve user experience:

**Changes Made:**
1. **Removed `initialize()` method** from `dewab/index.js` - This method was redundant and confusing
2. **Updated documentation** to show only two clear initialization patterns:
   - `Dewab.create()` for simple one-step initialization (recommended)  
   - `new Dewab()` + `dewab.connect()` for manual initialization when user interaction is required
3. **Simplified demo script** (`demo/script.js`) to use cleaner initialization logic
4. **Removed complex tracking variables** and simplified event handling in the demo

**Before (confusing):**
- Four different initialization methods: `Dewab.create()`, `new Dewab()`, `initialize()`, `connect()`
- Unclear guidance on when to use each method
- Complex demo script with redundant state tracking

**After (clean):**
- Two clear patterns with specific use cases
- Simplified API that's easier to learn and use
- Cleaner demo implementation

The library is now much more approachable for new users while maintaining all functionality.

## Fix automatic initial trigger causing audio issues - 2024-12-19 17:10

Identified and fixed an issue where Gemini was automatically sending a response immediately after connecting, before any user interaction.

**The Problem:**
- GeminiAgent was automatically sending a "." (dot) trigger message on connection
- This caused Gemini to respond with "Okay. How can I assist you today?" immediately
- Since no user interaction had occurred yet, AudioContext was still suspended
- Audio chunks would arrive but couldn't play, causing the jumbled audio effect on first response

**The Solution:**
- Removed the automatic initial trigger in `gemini-agent.js` line 244-250
- Now the conversation only starts when the user actually interacts (sends text or voice)
- This ensures AudioContext can be properly resumed on first user gesture
- Audio will play correctly from the very first response

**Files Changed:**
- `dewab/gemini/gemini-agent.js` - Removed automatic trigger logic

This fix ensures that audio works properly from the first user interaction, eliminating the need for users to "prime" the audio system with a dummy interaction.

## 2024-12-30: Fixed WebSocket Reconnection and Added Manual Connection Control

### Problem
- WebSocket connection was timing out after ~1 minute of inactivity (error code 1006)
- UI showed "Still waiting for Gemini..." even though the transport layer successfully reconnected
- Initial keep-alive implementation using space character caused Gemini to generate random responses

### Root Cause
- `gemini-agent.js` was missing an `open` event handler to update connection state on reconnection
- The `connected` flag was set to `false` on disconnect but never back to `true` on reconnect
- No `GEMINI_STATUS_UPDATE` event was emitted to notify the UI of reconnection

### Solution
1. **Added `open` event handler** in `gemini-agent.js` to:
   - Set `connected` and `initialized` flags to `true`
   - Emit `GEMINI_STATUS_UPDATE` event to notify UI

2. **Removed keep-alive mechanism** that was sending empty messages and causing unwanted responses

3. **Added manual connect/disconnect button** to give users control over the connection:
   - Added button to HTML UI
   - Exposed `eventBus` on Dewab instance for proper event handling
   - Updated demo script to handle connection state changes
   - Added visual feedback (green when disconnected, red when connected)

### Files Modified
- `dewab/gemini/connection/websocket-transport.js` - Removed keep-alive logic
- `dewab/gemini/gemini-agent.js` - Added open event handler and status update emission
- `dewab/index.js` - Exposed eventBus on instance, improved disconnect method
- `demo/index.html` - Added connect/disconnect button
- `demo/script.js` - Added connection control logic and event handling
- `demo/style.css` - Added button styling for connection states

### Result
Users can now manually control the WebSocket connection, avoiding timeout issues without the side effects of automatic keep-alive messages.

### Checkpoint: `demo_3` - Robust Gemini Tool Design

- **Date:** 2024-07-17
- **Project:** `dewab` - `demo_3`
- **Summary:** Successfully implemented and debugged voice control for an LED connected to an Arduino via the web demo. A critical insight was gained into designing robust tools for Google's Gemini model.

- **Problem:** An initial implementation used a single tool, `set_led_state(state: boolean)`, to control the LED. The language model had difficulty correctly interpreting natural language commands (e.g., "turn on the light") and would often fail to extract the correct boolean `state` parameter, instead passing incorrect arguments or `undefined`. This led to tool execution failures.

- **Solution:** The tool was refactored into two distinct, parameter-less functions: `turn_led_on` and `turn_led_off`. The `systemInstruction` was updated to guide the model on when to use each specific tool.

- **Key Takeaway:** For simple binary actions (on/off, true/false), providing discrete, purpose-specific tools is more reliable than a single, parameterized tool. This removes ambiguity for the model, significantly improving the reliability of its tool calls in response to natural language commands. The system is now more robust and correctly executes commands like "turn on the led".

### Checkpoint: `demo_3` - Parameterized Tools for Finer Control

- **Date:** 2024-07-17
- **Project:** `dewab` - `demo_3`
- **Summary:** Refactored the LED control logic to demonstrate a more complex, parameterized tool. This approach provides finer-grained control over multiple hardware components from a single function call.

- **Implementation:**
    1.  **Single, Multi-Target Tool:** Replaced the `turn_led_on`/`turn_led_off` tools with a single `set_lights` tool.
    2.  **Object Parameter:** This tool accepts an object as an argument, where keys are the names of the lights (`red`, `yellow`) and values are their desired boolean state (`true` for on, `false` for off).
    3.  **Flexible Command Handling:** The model can now handle commands that target one or multiple LEDs simultaneously (e.g., "turn the red light on and the yellow one off").
    4.  **System Prompting:** The `systemInstruction` was updated to guide Gemini on how to construct the argument object based on the user's natural language command, including ignoring colors that aren't mentioned.

- **Key Takeaway:** While simple, parameter-less functions are robust for binary tasks, a single, well-defined function with an object parameter is effective for controlling multiple, similar components. The key to success is a clear system prompt that teaches the model how to correctly structure the arguments for the tool call. This provides a powerful and flexible way to expose hardware control to the language model.

### Checkpoint: `demo_3` - Simplified, Robust Tool Design

- **Date:** 2024-07-17
- **Project:** `dewab` - `demo_3`
- **Summary:** After the parameterized `set_lights` tool proved too complex for the model to reliably use, the logic was refactored again to a simpler, more direct single-parameter design. This approach has proven to be the most robust.

- **Implementation:**
    1.  **Single-Action Tool:** Replaced the `set_lights({color, state})` tool with a new `control_led({action})` tool.
    2.  **String Enum Parameter:** The new tool takes a single `action` string, which is one of four explicit values: `red_on`, `red_on`, `yellow_on`, `yellow_off`.
    3.  **Defensive Handler:** The JavaScript handler for the tool was made more robust to handle potential malformed arguments from Gemini, though the simplified schema makes this less likely.

- **Key Takeaway:** When a large language model consistently fails to format tool calls correctly, even with clear instructions, the most effective solution is to **simplify the tool's schema**. Reducing the number of parameters and using simple, explicit string enumerations instead of complex, multi-property objects dramatically improves the model's reliability and the overall robustness of the system. This is a critical pattern for designing tools for AI agents.
